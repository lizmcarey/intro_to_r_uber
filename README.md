# Intro to R
This is a repo for a 3-day workshop on an intro to R and working with survey data. 

The first two days are taken from Amelia McNamara's [Intro to R](https://github.com/AmeliaMN/IntroToR/blob/master/README.md) workshop. 

The third day focuses primarily on using R with survey data. 

Day 1
- 01-Introduction (what is R, what is RStudio)
- 02-Visualization (visualizing data using `ggplot2`)
- 03-DataTypes (vectors, matrices, data frames, vector types, coercion)
- 04-Syntax (selecting rows and columns using base R and `dplyr`-- compare/contrast)

Day 2
- 06-Import (importing data using base R and `readr`-- compare/contrast)
- 07-BestPractices (cleaning up your workspace, ideas for organization, things to read)
- 08-Transform (more `dplyr`, making many-to-few and many-to-many transformations, joining data)
- 09-Tidy (skipped in the workshop, covers tidying data using `gather()` and `spread()`)
- 10-Model (linear modeling, `broom`, logistic regression)
- 11-GoingForward (installing R and RStudio locally, learning more and getting help)

Day 3 
- 12-Importing survey data from Qualtrics
- 13-Cleaning survey data from Qualtrics
- 14-Summary statistics and visualizations with survey data
