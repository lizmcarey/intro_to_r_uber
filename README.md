# Intro to R - NYC edition! 
This is a repository (repo) for 1 or 2 day workshop intro to R and working with survey data. 

Much of the content and material is adapted from Amelia McNamara's [Intro to R](https://github.com/AmeliaMN/IntroToR/blob/master/README.md) workshop. 

This workshop assumes no or beginner level experience with R. It will cover: 

Day 1
- 01-Introduction (what is R, what is RStudio)
- 02-Visualization (visualizing data using `ggplot2`)
- 03-DataTypes (vectors, ~~matrices~~, data frames, vector types, coercion)
- 04-Syntax (selecting rows and columns using ~~base R and~~ `dplyr`)

Day 2
- 06-Import (importing data using ~~base R and~~ `readr`)
- 07-Best Practices (cleaning up your workspace, ideas for organization, things to read)
- 08-Transform (more `dplyr`, making many-to-few and many-to-many transformations, joining data)
- 09-Tidy (tidying data using `gather()` and `spread()`)
- ~~10-Model (linear modeling, `broom`, logistic regression)~~
- 11-Going Forward (installing R and RStudio locally, learning more and getting help)

Day 3 
- 12-Importing survey data from Qualtrics
- 13-Cleaning survey data from Qualtrics
- 14-Summary statistics and visualizations with survey data
