# Intro to R Workshop 
This is a repository (repo) for a 1 or 2 day workshop intro to R and working with survey data. 

Much of the content and material is adapted from Amelia McNamara's [Intro to R](https://github.com/AmeliaMN/IntroToR/blob/master/README.md) workshop. 

I've cut down and adapted many of the slides from her workshop to give user researchers a tldr of quick R functions to get them up and running with their own survey analysis! 

Follow along with the workshop content using [these slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e94XmcxtlETH5ccrBnv7JSM3H9BjwjG8/view?usp=sharing)

By the end of the workshop, you'll be able to produce your own basic analysis like [this workbook](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lizmcarey/intro_to_r_workshop/blob/master/survey_analysis.html) 

This workshop assumes **no** or **beginner level** experience with R. It will cover: 

Content:
- 01-Introduction (what is R & RStudio, R packages, Tidyverse)
- 02-Data Types (Vectors, coercion, data frames & tibbles)
- 03-Subsetting data (Select, filter, arrange) 
- 04-Transforming data (Summarize, group by, join)
- 05-Tidy data (Tidying data using gather() and spread())
- 06-Visualization: Visualizing data using ggplot2
- 07-Importing data: Importing data into R using readr
- 08-Survey Analysis: Complete a basic survey analysis
- 09-Best Practices: Workspace, ideas for organization, things to read
- 10-Going Forward: Learning more and getting help

Complete these slides and you'll be up and running with R to compelte basic data and survey analysis!
